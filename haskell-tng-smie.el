;;
;;  SMIE precedence table, providing s-expression navigation, and indentation
;;  rules.
;;
;;  Although SMIE provides the primary indentation suggest (when the user types
;;  RETURN), we cycle through alternative candidates on TAB. The philosophy is
;;  not to try and get indentation right 100% of the time, but to get it right
;;  90% of the time and make it so easy to fix it that it doesn't get in the
;;  way.
;;
;;  Users may consult the SMIE manual to customise their indentation rules:
;;  https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/elisp.html#SMIE
;;
;;; Code:

(require 'smie)

(require 'haskell-tng-font-lock)
(require 'haskell-tng-lexer)

;; https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/elisp.html#SMIE-Grammar
;; https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellch3.html
;; https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/blob/master/compiler/parser/Parser.y
;;
;; Many of these grammar rules cannot be expressed in SMIE because Haskell uses
;; whitespace separators a lot, whereas the BNF must use non-terminals.
;;
;; Rules that are unbounded on the right tend to misbehave quite badly, since
;; there is no way to know how to end the s-expression. For example, the BNF
;; definition of a TYPE will typically extend to an arbitrary point later in the
;; file. We cannot use `;' to end the TYPE definition, because symbols cannot be
;; closers and "neither" (i.e. infix) at the same time. An option is always to
;; push contextual functionality into the lexer, but one must draw a line
;; somewhere.
;;
;; We do not include rules unless they have an impact on indentation. Navigation
;; with a more complete grammar has been shown to be less than satisfactory,
;; therefore there is no reason to do more than is needed.
